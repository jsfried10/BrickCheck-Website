      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="privacy-updated">Last updated: February 22, 2026</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>BrickChecker is designed with your privacy in mind. The app runs on Mac, iPhone, and iPad and does not collect any personal information. BrickChecker does not contain ads, tracking SDKs, or telemetry. The app optionally syncs your tracked sets and settings across your devices using Apple iCloud.</p>

      <h2>What Data Does BrickChecker Store?</h2>
      <p>BrickChecker stores the following data <strong>on your device</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>LEGO set numbers you choose to track</li>
        <li>Your LEGO.com wishlist URL (if you use wishlist sync)</li>
        <li>Price data retrieved from retailers</li>
        <li>Your notification preferences and app settings</li>
        <li>Cached images of LEGO sets (stored on device for faster loading)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The app makes network requests to retailer websites and third-party APIs solely to fetch prices and set information. Only LEGO set numbers and search terms are included in these requests — no personal data is sent.</p>

      <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>
      <p>BrickChecker uses Apple iCloud to optionally sync your data across your Mac, iPhone, and iPad. When iCloud sync is enabled, the following data is stored on Apple's iCloud servers under your Apple ID:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your tracked LEGO sets and their price history</li>
        <li>App settings such as notification preferences, wishlist URL, and sort options</li>
      </ul>
      <p>iCloud sync is <strong>enabled by default</strong> and can be toggled off in the app's Settings (requires an app restart to take effect). When enabled, your data is governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>. Apple encrypts iCloud data in transit and at rest.</p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>Local data is stored within the app's sandbox on your device. BrickChecker uses the App Sandbox to restrict access to only the resources it needs. When iCloud sync is enabled, data is encrypted by Apple both in transit and at rest.</p>

      <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
      <p>You can delete local data at any time by removing BrickChecker from your device. If iCloud sync was enabled, your data may also be stored in iCloud. To delete iCloud data, go to your device's Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; iCloud &gt; Manage Storage and remove BrickChecker's data. Note that deleting iCloud data will remove it from all synced devices.</p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>BrickChecker is not directed at children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.</p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>BrickChecker contacts retailer websites and third-party APIs to fetch LEGO set prices and product information. Only LEGO set numbers and search terms are sent in these requests — no personal or identifying information is transmitted. The app does not contain ads, tracking SDKs, or telemetry. When iCloud sync is enabled, data is synced through Apple's iCloud service.</p>

      <p>Some product links within BrickChecker may contain affiliate tags. If you click a product link and make a purchase, the developer may earn a small commission at no additional cost to you. These affiliate networks may use their own cookies and tracking — please refer to their respective privacy policies for details.</p>
